I have forked this folder to learn how to work in some organization code without disturbing their code 
How I did this:
      ~ go to the organization page in which you want to contribute
      ~ go to the project folder
      ~ at the top right corner there is a tab called fork 
      ~ click it and it will be imported to your profile

      done
